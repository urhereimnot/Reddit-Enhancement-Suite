### New features

- NOTE: we've changed the default setting for moving images to use ctrl-arrow keys rather than shift and arrow keys to avoid a common conflict for users (thanks in part to @squarific)
- Updated the "No Participation" module based on feedback from moderators of various subs (thanks @andytuba)
- Added an option to turn off the CSS icon in the address bar (allows you to toggle subreddit styles)

- Various code cleanup and triage (thanks @mc10)
