## v3.0

### New features

- General
	- Completely overhauled how settings are stored, separately for each browser, to hopefully avoid losing settings when private data is cleared.
		- Chrome, Opera, Safari: Each using their respective extension background page to store settings
		- Firefox: Using Greasemonkey's GM_setValue / GM_getValue to store settings
	- Some other miscellaneous architecture changes that should speed things up a bit
	- Added some code to adjust the order of "save", "source" links etc so they're more consistent with each other
- Comment Navigator **NEW MODULE!
	- When browsing long comment threads, the Comment Navigator provides an easy way to scan for posts by Submitted, Moderator or Admin
- betteReddit
	- Added "Manage Subreddits" option, which provides an editable subreddit bar
		- NOTE: All browsers except Opera will support drag/drop editing of this bar.  Opera unfortunately has chosen not to support drag events yet.
- Keyboard Navigation
	- Added a new commandline command: user [username] goes to that user's profile page
	- Added "s" shortcut to save a link when the link (on a comments page) is selected
	- "s" shortcut will save/unsave comments when a comment is selected
	- Updated style of "selected" keyboard nav item so it doesn't "take space" and jiggle text around... (except in Opera due to a CSS quirk, sorry Opera users)
- Inline Image Viewer
	- Added thumbnail preview (when hovering over an image expander button)
	- Updated placement of images on link list pages to avoid "jumping" on expansion and/or drag and drop
- Save Comments
	- Changed how saved comments are stored in prep for RES Pro sync
- Style Tweaks
	- replaced commentBoxHover with a new name so people can still turn it on if they like it, but now it defaults to off - it's a CPU hog.
- Uppers and Downers Enhanced
	- Added date/time of submissions on rollover (thanks to semanticist for the contribution!)
	- Module now also runs on a user's "liked" tab

### Bug fixes

	- fixed [check for update] button in RES console in Opera

- Style Tweaks
	- Fixed some overlooked items on Dark theme (thanks FillInTheBlank)
- SingleClick Opener
	- Fixed an issue opening javascript:void(0) tabs on middle click
- Inline image viewer
	- Fixed to work properly on user pages again
