## v2.2

### New features

- Keyboard Navigation
	- Added a new key, "x" by default, to expand image/text/video expandos. Note RES can't autoplay videos because they're in iFrames.
	- Updated the commentLinksNewTab option so that if it's off, you can use regular/middle click to choose whether or not to open in a new tab.
- Live Comment Preview
	- Added ~~strikethrough~~ and super^script support
	- Updated to be in line with the bug-fixed version of markdown that Reddit has upgraded to (fixes things like look_of_disapproval) making _of_ italicized.
	- Added "source" button to show markdown source of other comments...
	- Removed referral link from [Promote] button because some users were concerned about it looking 'spammy'
