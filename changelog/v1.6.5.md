## v1.65

### New features

- Core Code
	- Made some more improvements to efficiency in a few modules to release control of the browser
		- Specifically, delegated chunking of applying DOM changes to really large pages.
- Inline Image Viewer
	- The image viewer now skips over images it has already revealed (so you won't see the same image twice)
- Save Comments
	- Moved "save" button before "reply" button to avoid accidental link saving.
- Keyboard Navigation
	- Added the option for comment links (numbered links) to open in a new tab/window - this is the default

### Bug fixes

- Subreddit Tagger
	- Fixed a bug where subreddits with mixed case weren't being tagged properly
- Hide Comments
	- Fixed a problem where the "automatic" setting wasn't functioning properly
