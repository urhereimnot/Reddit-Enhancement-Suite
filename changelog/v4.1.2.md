## v4.1.2

### New features

- DeviantART and Tumblr links are no longer rewritten - thanks to a huge improvement made in Firefox, this will only detrimentally affect Opera and Safari users who use "view all images" on pages full of these links...
- Made some huge performance improvements in Opera
- Direct link to users' links and comments now exist in the user hover tooltip

### Bug fixes

- Reddit made a breaking change (moving location of saved links) making it impossible for RES users to get to saved comments - this is fixed.
- Fixed a bug causing the "About RES" panel not to display in the console for Firefox users
- Fixed an issue with live comment preview and attachment to the top level comment even when not necessary
- Fixed a few CSS issues (thanks gavin19!)
- Uppers and downers now work on user profile pages past page #1
- Some new updates to back button detection for Never Ending Reddit should make it a little smoother
- A number of other minor/misc tweaks and bugfixes
