## v1.85

### New features

- Core code
	- Perhaps something between a 'new feature' and a 'bug fix' - now hiding the ad bar when bringing up the console so there aren't overlap problems preventing you from saving preferences.
- Style Tweaks
	- Lightswitch! Switch on demand between a light/dark theme. Note that there's unfortunately nothing I can do about the wait to convert from light to dark when loading a page in the dark theme. Sorry. Nature of userscripts.
	- Updated Comment Boxes with the option to round corners
	- Also updated Comment Boxes to not expand the full width of the browser, per user request
	- One more comment boxes thing: Default turns off the dropshadows, in the name of performance.
- RES Tips
	- New - a tips and tricks tooltip will pop up no more than once every 24 hours, teaching you something you may not already know about RES!
	- You can also access tips from the console - click [RES], then the help (?) icon in the console.

### Bug fixes

- Inline Image Viewer
	- Fixed a few miscellaneous bugs - a minor image search bug, and a bug with overlap in webkit browsers with images/menus
- Core code
	- Fixed a broken link to the API, oops!
- User tagger
	- Fixed a date bug with the rollover
