## v2.7

### New features

- Keyboard Navigation
	- Added the keyNav commandline!  Hit "." on any page to bring it up.
		- typing r/[subreddit] sends you to that subreddit
		- typing a number on a selected comment clicks that link
		- typing a number on a link list page clicks the link with that ranking number
		- typing tag bob would tag the currently highlighted user as "bob"
		- typing m takes you to your messages
		- typing mm takes you to your moderator messages
		- typing sw funkypants would switch you to the user "funkypants" in Account Switcher
		- typing ls toggles the lightSwitch function
- Account Switcher
	- Added "keep me logged in" option to account switcher (default is false for security reasons)
- Never Ending Reddit
	- Finally added error detection! Now when NER fails to get an actual page from its load, you'll know! You can then click to try again.
	- Also added the ability to click the NER box just in case the content isn't large enough to allow you to scroll (which is what normally triggers it)
- Inline Image Viewer
	- Updated HTML/CSS so that inline image links do not take up the whole "row"
- Spam Button
	- Added the spam button to comment pages and user profile pages
- Save Comments
	- Changed the way saved comments are stored in preparation for exciting new functionality... :)
- User Tagger
	- Changed the way user tags / vote info are stored, also in preparation for exciting new functionality!

	- Fixed a bug that would not allow inline images to close after a certain sequence of events

	- Fixed a bug where viewing source on a permalinked comment showed the wrong info
	- Fixed a bug where no view source links appeared on root level comments...
