## v2.1

### New features

- Live Comment Preview
	- Added preview to self/text posts
- New Comment Count
	- Now incrementing comment count when you submit a comment, so that your own posted comments don't count as "new"
- Inline Image Viewer
	- Increased efficiency (to avoid locking the browser while loading big comments pages) by scanning the page in chunks, as other modules are doing...
- SingleClick opener
	- Middle click now works in Chrome and Safari to open links+comments in a background tab.
	- NOTE: Firefox and opera simply do  not support controlling this with Javascript. Firefox users: you can go to about:config and set browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground to true if you like. Note that this means ALL new tabs will be unfocused. Not just from RES.
- Keyboard Nav
	- Shift-L (for singleclick opener keyboard shortcut) opens links+comments in background tab
	- NOTE: Same browser restrictions apply. Firefox/Opera just can't do this.
