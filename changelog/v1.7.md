## v1.7

### New features

- Core Code
	- Opera Compatibility!*
		- * With minor limitations because Opera doesn't support cross-domain requests in user scripts...
			- Part of the inline image viewer that converts imgur links for more reliable image display will not work, as this requires a cross domain request.
	- Added a sanity check on URLs because some people's "include" settings are being ignored and the script is running on non-reddit sites.
- User Tagger
	- Added new rollover amazingness!  You'll just have to roll over a username and see for yourself.
- Style Tweaks
	- Drastically increased efficiency of comment boxes styling on large comment pages so it won't freeze up your browser while it renders...

### Bug fixes

- Inline Image Viewer / Keyboard Navigation
	- Fixed a bug where keyboard navigation was causing issues with inline image viewer (borking middle click to open in a "passive" tab)
