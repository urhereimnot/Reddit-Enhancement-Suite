## v0.96

### New Features

- Uppers and Downers
	- Added the option to show +/- signs by karma points (see preferences)
- Keyboard Navigation
	- Updated how it works for comments page - added the ability to move up to the original post and hit reply.
	- Also, in "sub comments pages" (i.e. a context link), hitting reply when the original post is selected goes to the main comments page so you can reply.
	- Added the ability to "Load more comments" just like expanding/collapsing comments -- caveat: you won't be able to keyboard nav through them just yet... that's going to be challenging to add.
- Inline Image View
	- Now shows total images found

### Bug fixes

- Core
	- Fixed a bug where RES was checking for updates too often
- Keyboard Navigation
	- Fixed a bug where you couldn't up/downvote links that had thumbnails
	- Fixed a bug where keyboard navigation wasn't active on non-subreddit comments page (I didn't even know those existed!)
	- Un-broke following links/comments in a new tab - they're now configurable as separate keycodes, too.
- Inline Image View
	- Fixed a bug where images in comments weren't detected properly
