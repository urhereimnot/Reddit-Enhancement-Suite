### Bug fixes

- Significant updates to Never Ending Reddit's feature that attempts you to scroll you back where you were upon return from the back button. It's never going to be perfect (for crazy technical reasons), but in my testing thus far, this has worked pretty well.
- Settings console subreddit autocomplete dropdown visible again
- account switcher works for passwords containing +
- "limit search to subreddit" works in multi-reddits
- hiding posts works in multi-subreddits
- image gallery expandos don't show the wrong caption if the image lacks a caption
- tumblr expando in comments toggles properly instead of opening several times
- flickr expando improvements
- Comment "show source" loading/toggling fixed
- Excessive saves to localStorage less excessive (how often, not how much)
- Night mode CSS tidied up, added multireddit support
- "hide child comments" works when "gift gold" is open
- Keyboard navigation's 'go to link' only observes real links
- Username hider doesn't break mod pages
- Private mode respected in Firefox
- Upvote/downvote count fixed on /r/subreddit/comments page
- fixed broken memegen support, livememe support
- fix for broken selftext toggles
- fix for wrong-sized tumblr and other buttons on certain pages
- all sorts of other small bugs/quirks
