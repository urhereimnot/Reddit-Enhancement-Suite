## v1.6

### New features

- User Tagger
	- Not a new feature, exactly, but I've increased the efficiency of this module significantly, even on first scan.
- Save Comments
	- Surprise! I've added a module that allows you to save comments.
	- Note: Comments are saved just like preferences, on your local machine, not somehow magically to your reddit account.
- Hide Child Comments
	- Updated the interface to toggle states, rather than just saying "toggle", says "hide" or "show", whichever is appropriate.

### Bug fixes

- Keyboard Navigation
	- Finally figured out what was going on with Mac's command key, added support for that - no more Apple-F taking you to the homepage, I hope.
